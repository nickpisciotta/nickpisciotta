### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated, hardworking individual with a passion for people, science and technology. As someone with high ambitions and an endless thirst for knowledge, I am always pushing my limits. From my prior work in cancer research to projects in software development, I try to use research and technology to enhance people's lives. Be it through health care, software, or by simply making someone laugh, I enjoy making people's lives better.
